# ahk-scripts

My own personal Auto Hot Keys script.

## Why

I'm lazy and do repetitive stuff manually is boring

## Inspired by others

This script is inspired by [TaranVH scripts](https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard) and [Vonng scripts](https://github.com/Vonng/Capslock) but customized to my own needs and practices.

## Hotkeys
